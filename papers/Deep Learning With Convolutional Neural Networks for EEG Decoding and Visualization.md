## Goal

    * Proposal of the deep ConvNets with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executes tasks from raw EEG signals

## Contributions

    * Suggestion of the first deep ConvNets with similar performance to FBCSP
    * Evaluation of a large number of ConvNet design on an EEG decoding task
    * Suggestion of the cropped training method to increase the decoding accuracy
    * Development of visualization methods to confirm what deep ConvNets learned

## Methods

    * Input representation
    	* EEG as an image
    * Deep ConvNet for raw EEG signals

## Experiments

## Results

## Discussion

## Limitations

    * Input 데이터 크기에 유동적이지 않은 모델 구조
    * Pooling으로 인한 정보 손실
    * cropped training으로 인한 noisy label 문제
    * ResNet 학습되지 않음
