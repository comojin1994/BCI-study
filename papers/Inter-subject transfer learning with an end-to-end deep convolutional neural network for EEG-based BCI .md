## Goal

    * Proposal of framework based on the CNNs to detect the attentive mental state from single-channel raw EEG data

## Contributions

    * Development of an end-to-end network in order to efficiently learn from raw EEG data
    * Suggestion of the classification strategy with inter-subject transfer learning techniques
    * Visualization of outcomes to interpret the features learned through the CNNs

## Methods

    * Data acquitision
    	* 120 healthy subjects with Stroop color test (frontal area)
    * Data preprocessing
    	* 2 s sliding window with 50 % overlapping
    	* Max 100 mv amplitude
    	* above 0.5 Hz
    * Input representation
    	* Raw EEG with default data preprocessing
    	* Raw EEG with default data preprocessing + 0.5-40 Hz band-pass filter
    	* Raw EEG with default data preprocessing + classical bands
