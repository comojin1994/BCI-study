## Goal

    * Suggestion of a novel framework of spectral-spatial feature representation using CNNs from a large-scale MI EEG database

## Contributions

    * Construction of the largest MI-based database
    * Suggestion of a new discriminative spectral-spatial input
    * Representation of the MI-induced ERD pattern through the CNN model

## Methods

    * Related works
    	* CSSP, FBCSP, BSSFO methods require the calibration procedure to train the decoder
    	* 2 key issues
    		1. No large-scale MI database with a large number of subjects and sessions
    		2. Scarce studies on subject-independent BCIs-based on DL
    * Data acquisition and experimental setup
    	* 54 healthy subjects
    	* the interval between the sessions was between one and two weeks
    	* Downsampled to 100 Hz by the Nyquist theory
    	* MI paradigm
    		* 3 s with fixation cross
    		* 4 s for performing the MI task
    		* 6 s for rest
    		* experiment is composed of an offline and an online phase
    * Spectral-Spatial Feature Representation (SSFR)
    	*
